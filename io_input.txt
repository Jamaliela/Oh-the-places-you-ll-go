Reverse Poem: Expectation for the Future

by Lara Cheung, Celia Leung, Julia Wong 3P
 	
There is HOPE in my life
It is foolish to presume that
My future is blank and I am a failure
I tell you this
I will make contributions to this society
It is impossible that
Our society will collapse
I believe
I will have a colourful and bright future
It is a lie that
I will be a good for nothing in the future
It is possible that
I can be a successful person
I definitely don't believe that
I have no expectations for my future
